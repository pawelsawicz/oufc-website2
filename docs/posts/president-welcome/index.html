      <div class="content"><p>Welcome to the Oxford University Fencing Club website!</p>
<p>Founded in 1891, OUFC is one of Britain’s oldest and most successful fencing clubs. The club caters for all levels, from beginners to international.</p>
<p>Foil, epee and sabre training are all on offer at the club. Advanced and intermediate fencers receive expert tuition from our club coach, Tomek Walicki, who leads a weekly training session and offers individual lessons throughout the week. In addition there are two club nights every week with a mixture of coached, structured and free fencing. The quality of fencing is high across all three weapons and several members represent their country internationally. The club also benefits from several non-university members attending training sessions.</p>
<p>The highlight of the season for the squad is the annual Varsity match against Cambridge. This year, the 111th match is being played in Oxford’s Examination Schools on Saturday March 10th, 2018. The club has four teams (Men’s Firsts; Women’s Firsts; Men’s Seconds; Women’s Seconds) which compete in regular BUCS competitions and have a highly successful track record. Fencers also compete individually in domestic and international competitions.</p>
<p>The club also has a flourishing program for people new to fencing. Our beginners are guided by two British Fencing Association (BFA)-qualified coaches. Fencers work towards the annual Novice Varsity match which takes place in Trinity Term and will be hosted here in Oxford in 2018. This gives beginners the opportunity to fence competitively and experience a match against our arch rivals.</p>
<p>There is also a very active social side to OUFC (amongst other things also known as Oxford University FUN Club). Highlights of the year include Freshers’ Drinks, Christmas Dinner, the Old Blues’ Dinner, (pirate) punting, a summer BBQ and many informal pub trips in-between, often post-training. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact myself or one of the team captains.</p>
